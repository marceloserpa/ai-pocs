duced by Christopher Nolan.
It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin,

Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film
follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in
search of a new home for mankind.
Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its
origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007.
Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics[4] Kip Thorne
was an executive producer, acted as a scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in
book, The Science of Interstellar.
Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision
anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm.
Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland,
and Los Angeles.
